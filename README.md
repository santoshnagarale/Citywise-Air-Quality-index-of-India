# Citywise-Air-Quality-index-of-India
India's major developing/developed cities are consider to this project. 



*Feature Description
1. PM2.5: It refers to particles that have diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. These particles are formed as a result of burning fuel and chemical reactions that take place in the atmosphere.

2. PM10: PM10 are the particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers. These particles are a complex mixture of soot,smoke,metals,nitrates,sulphates etc

3. NO: Nitric oxide is not considered to be hazardous to health at typical ambient concentrations, but nitrogen dioxide can be.

4. NO2: Nitrogen dioxide is part of a group of gaseous air pollutants produced as a result of road traffic and other fossil fuel combustion processes. Its presence in air pollutants.

5. NH3: Gaseous ammonia (NH3) is the most abundant alkaline gas in the atmosphere. NH3 plays a significant role in the formation of atmospheric particulate matter.

6. CO: It is produced in the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels such as gasoline,natural gas,oil,coal and wood.

7. SO2: It is formed when fuel containing sulphur such as coal and oil, is burned,creating air pollution.

8. O3: It is harmful to air quality outside of the ozone layer.Ground level ozone is a colorless and highly irritating gas that forms just above the earth's surface.

9. Benzene:The benzene in indoor comes from product that contain benzene such as glues,paints , furniture wax , and detergents.

10. Toluene: Motor vehicle and industrial emmissions are the major sources of pollutants .

11. Xylene: Motor vechicle emissions are the predominant source of xylene in the urban air environment. Evaporation from petroleum fuel storage facilities and service stations.

12. AQI: The air quality index is an index for reporting air quality on a daily basis. It is a measure of how air pollution affects one's health with in short time period. The purpose of the AQI is to help know how the local air quality impacts their health.
